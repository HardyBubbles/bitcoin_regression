# Bitcoin price prediction  

Starting a new quick project, let's try to write a time series prediction for the bitcoin price.
Let's take a small dataset from some past, try to achieve the smallest MAE for linear regression.

We will use data for five-minute intervals, try to reduce the value of the target metric as much as possible and optimize the preprocessing procedures.
